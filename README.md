# CAPTCHA Classification using Matlab

CAPTCHAs are distorted images containing letters and digits used in cyber-security to determine if the user of a software or website is human or not. The images are designed in a way that makes it difficult for a computer program to read the letters and digits in the images, but it is still possible for a human to determine the content.

The project aims at classifying the individual digits in a set of provided CAPTCHA images.
